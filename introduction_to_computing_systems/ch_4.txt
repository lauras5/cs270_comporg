CHAPTER 4: VON NEUMAN MODEL

4.1 Basic Components
    computer program consists of set of instructions. Instruction is the smallest piece of work
    specified in a computer program
    Carries out instruction or doesn't carry out instruction. No pieces.
    5 parts: memory, processing unit, input, output, and a control unit
    4.1.1 Memory
        modern 2^28 by 8 bits --> address space of 2^28 unique locations, addressability of 8 bits
        256-megabyte, byte=8bits
        k bits, we can represent uniquely 2k items
        Accessing memory:
        - provide address we want to read/write
        - to read, address --> MAR --> info --> MDR
        - to write, write address --> MAR --> value --> MDR --> WE asserted
    4.1.2 Processing Unit
        processing of info on computer
        ALU - Arithmetic and Logic Unit, performs:
        - basic arithmetic functions (ADD & SUBTRACT)
        - basic logic operations (bit-wise AND, OR, NOT)
        word length - size of the quantities normally processed by the ALU
        LC-3 word length is 16-bits
        LC-3 has 8 registers (R0, R1, ... R7), each containing 16 bits
    4.1.3 Input and Output
        peripherals
        for LC-3 we will use keyboard for input, monitor for output
    4.1.1 Control Unit
        Like orchestra conductor, makes parts work together
        has instruction register to contain instructions and keep track of what is next
        PC program counter, aka instruction pointer

4.2 The LC-3: An Example von Neumann Machine
    MEMORY: consists of the storage elements, along with the MAR for addressing individual locations
    and the MDR for holding the contents of a memory location on its way to/from the storage
    INPUT/OUTPUT: keyboard and monitor.
    simple keyboard 2 registers --> data register (KBDR) & status register (KBSR)
    KBDR holds ASCII codes of keys struck, KBSR maintaining status info of keys struck
    simple monitor  registers: --> DDR & DSR
    DDR holds ASCII of what to display on screen, DSR status info
    PROCESSING UNIT: consists of a functional unit that can perform arithmetic
    and logic operations (ALU) and eight registers (R0,... R7) for storing temporary
    values that will be needed in the near future as operands
    CONTROL UNIT: FSM most important

4.3 Instruction Processing
    4.3.1 The Instruction
        made up of two parts, the opcode (what the instruction does) and the operands (who it is to do it to)
        [15:12] contain opcode, [11:0] where operands are
    4.3.2 The Instruction Cycle
        sequence of steps is called the instruction cycle, and each step is referred to as a phase
        6 Phases: fetch, decode, evaluate address, fetch operands, execute, store result
        FETCH: obtains the next instruction from memory and loads it into the instruction register (IR) of the control unit
            Step 1: Load the MAR with the contents of the PC, and simultaneously increment the PC.(1 MC)
            Step 2: Interrogate memory, resulting in the instruction being placed in the MDR. (1+ MC)
            Step 3: Load the IR with the contents of the MDR. (1 MC)
        DECODE: examines the instruction in order to figure out what the microarchitecture is being asked to do (1MC)
        EVALUATE ADDRESS: computes the address of the memory location that is needed to process the instruction
        FETCH OPERANDS: obtains the source operands needed to process the instruction
        EXECUTE: This phase carries out the execution of the instruction
        STORE RESULT: result is written to its designated destination

4.4 Changing the Sequence of Execution
    loading the PC during the EXECUTE phase, which wipes out the incremented PC that was loaded dur- ing the FETCH phase
    4.4.1 Control of the Instruction Cycle
        clock cycles of phases

4.5 Stopping the computer
    If the RUN latch is in the 1 state (i.e., Q â€” 1), the output of the clock circuit is the same as the output
    of the clock generator. If the RUN latch is in the 0 state (i.e., Q = 0), the output of the clock circuit is 0.
