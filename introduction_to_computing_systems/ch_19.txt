CHAPTER 19 : DATA STRUCTURES

19.1 Intro
    C has 3 fund types of data: integers, characters, float point values
    structures -> convenient way of representing obj that are rep by mult vals
19.2 Structures
    - define a new type
    ** see flightType.c example **
    19.2.2 Implementing Structures in C
        array can be accessed in random order
        linked list must be traversed sequentially
        ** insertion and deletion can be cheaper to perform on a linked list than on an array.
  - dynamic data structures that grow and shrink during program execution require some form of
    memory allocation
    -  malloc,calloc,realloc,and free.
  - linked list is a dynamic structure that can be expanded or shrunk during execution
  - connecting data elements together using pointers
  - malloc --> init w/ garbage values
  - calloc --> init w/ 0
    - return pointer to value, or null
    - free() deallocates mem from heap
