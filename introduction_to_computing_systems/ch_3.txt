CHAPTER 3 : Digital Logic Structures

3.1 The Transistor
    Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS), circuits with both n & p type are called Complimentary MOS
    p-type and n-type
    P-type transistors work the opposite of type n
    n --> open = off, 0 / p --> open = on, 1
3.2 Logic Gates
    Construct basic logc structures out of individual MOS transistors
    AND, OR, NOT ...
    3.2.1 The NOT Gate (Inverter)
