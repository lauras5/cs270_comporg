CHAPTER 1
1.1
    All computers can perform the same functions, but the more powerful ones do it faster.
1.2
    Higher level languages simply allow humans to write programs more quickly and easily,
    but they perform the same functions and are translated into lower level languages to be run.
1.3
    It's difficult to increase accuracy w/ analog machines, very easy on digital machines.
1.4
    Ambiguity
1.5

1.7 How do we get electronics to do the work?
    Levels of Transformation:
        Problem, Algorithm, language, machine (ISA) architecture, microarchitecture, circuits,
        devices
    1.7.1 The Statement of the problem
        Natural language is filled with ambiguity.
    1.7.2 The Algorithm:
        Transform the problem into words a computer can understand, an algorithm.
    1.7.5 The Micro-architecture:
        Detailed organization of an implementation.
