CHAPTER 5: THE LC-3

5.1 The ISA: Overview
    the ISA specifies everything in the computer that is available to a programmer when he/she writes programs
    in the computer's own machine language
    5.1.1 Memory Organization
        LC-3 memory has an address space of 2^16 addressability of 16 bits
    5.1.2 Registers
        Registers must be uniquely identifiable. The LC-3 specifies eight GPRs, each
        identified by a 3-bit register number. They are referred to as RO, R1,...R7
    5.1.3 The Instruction Set
        The instruction set of an ISA is defined by its set of opcodes, data types, and addressing modes.
    5.1.4 Opcodes
        three different types of opcodes: operates, data movement, and control.
        Operate instructions process information.
        Data movement instructions move info between memory & registers and between registers/memory & input/output devices.
        Control instructions change the sequence of instructions that will be executed.

    5.1.5 Data Types
        LC-3: 2's complement integers
    5.1.6 Addressing Modes
        a mechanism for specifying where the operand is located
        If the operand is a part of the instruction, we refer to it as a literal or as an immediate operand
        The LC-3 supports five addressing modes: immediate (or literal), register,
        and three memory addressing modes: PC-relative, indirect, and Base+offset.
    5.1.7 Condition Codes
        Each time a GPR is written, the N, Z, and P registers are individually set to 0 or 1
        If the result is negative, the N register is set, and Z and P are cleared
        If the result is zero, Z is set and N and P are cleared
        if the result is positive, P is set and N and Z are cleared

5.2 Operate Instructions

5.3 Data Movement Instructions
    moving information from memory --> register = load
    moving information from register --> memory = store
    The LC-3 contains seven instructions that move information: LD, LDR, LDI, LEA, ST, STR, and STI
    2 operands - source and destination
    [11:9] register, [8:0] address gen bits
    5.3.1 PC-relative mode
        LD (opcode = 0010) and ST (opcode = 0011) specify the PC-relative addressing mode
    5.3.2 indirect mode
        LDI (opcode â€” 1010) and STI (opcode = 1011) specify the indirect addressing mode
    5.3.3 Base+offset mode
        LDR (opcode = 0110) and STR (opcode = 0111) specify the Base+offset addressing mode
    5.3.4 Immediate Mode
        LEA (opcode =1110)

5.4 Control Instructions
    The LC-3 has five opcodes that enable this sequential flow to be broken: conditional branch,
    unconditional jump, subroutine (sometimes called function) call, TRAP, and return from interrupt
    5.4.3 Two Methods for loop control
        counter or sentinel
    5.6.1 Basic components of the data path
        The Global Bus: one value can be transferred on the bus at one time
            structure wishing to obtain the value being supplied can do so by asserting its LD
