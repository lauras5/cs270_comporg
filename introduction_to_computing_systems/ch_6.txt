CHAPTER 6: PROGRAMMING

6.1 Problem Solving
    6.1.1 Systemic Decomposition
        natural language description of problem --> transform problem into an algorithm, step by step procedure
        has the properties of finiteness (it terminates), definiteness (each step is precisely stated), and effective
        computability (each step can be carried out by a computer).
    6.1.2 The Three Constructs: Sequential, Conditional, Iterative
         STEPWISE REFINEMENT, because the process is applied one step at a time, and each step refines one of the
         tasks that is still too complex into a collection of simpler subtasks
         Sequential - the computer is to carry out the first subtask completely, then go on and carry out the second subtask completely
         Conditional - doing one of two subtasks but not both, depending on some condition.
         Iterative - doing a subtask a number of times, but only as long as some condition is true
    6.1.4 The Character Count Example from Chapter 5, Revisited
         first to examine exactly what is being asked for, and what is available to help solve the problem

6.2 Debugging
    keeping track of the sequence of instructions that have been executed & results produced by each instruction
    6.2.1 Debugging Operations
        Set Values - deposit values in memory and in registers in order to test the execution of a part of a program in isolation
        Execute Sequences - run, step, and set breakpoints, single stepping (execute one option then stop)
        Display Values -
