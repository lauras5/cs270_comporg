CHAPTER 2 : Bits and Data Types

2.1 Bits and Data Types
    2.1.1 The Bit as the Unit of Information
        Presence of a voltage as "1" and the absence of a voltage as "0"
        Voltages close to 0 vs voltages far from 0
    2.1.2 Data Types
        2's complement integers & ASCII codes

2.2 Integer Data Types
    2.2.1 Unsigned Integers
        RANGE: 0 - 2^k - 1
        common uses --> identifying different memory locations, count
    2.2.2 Signed Integers
        RANGE: -(2(k-1)) to 2^(k-1) â€” 1
        positive # have leading 0, neg have leading 1
        1's complement, take the representation of the positive number having the same magnitude,
            and "flip" all the bits

2.3 2's Compliment Integers
     Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) has two inputs and one output
     Adds 2 binary patterns
     Flip bits
     2's complement integers that can be represented in the LC-3 are the integers
        from -32,768 to +32,767.

2.4 Binary-Decimal Conversion
    2.4.1 Binary to Decimal Conversion
        a7 --> 0 pos, 1 neg
        magnitude = adding the powers of 2 that have coefficients of 1
    2.4.2 Decimal to Binary Conversion
        divide by 2, remainder is added to binary
2.5 Operations on Bits - Part 1 Arithmetic
    2.5.1 Addition and Subtraction
    2.5.3 Overflow
